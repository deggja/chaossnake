## ‚≠ê What is Chaos Snake? ‚≠ê

Chaos Snake lets you play snake while wrecking havock in your Kubernetes cluster. Have fun while you can.

### How does it work? ü§î

Each piece of food you eat corresponds to a pod in your cluster (I left out kube-system though..).

## Installation

### Homebrew üç∫

To install Chaos Snake using Homebrew, you can run the following commands:

```sh
brew tap deggja/chaossnake https://github.com/deggja/chaossnake
brew install chaossnake
```

### Build from source üíª

To build Chaos Snake from the source, you need a working Go environment with version 1.21 or higher. Follow these steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deggja/chaossnake.git --depth 1
cd chaossnake
go build -o chaossnake
```

## Usage

### Starting the game

To start the game, simply run the compiled binary:

```sh
./chaossnake
```

This will run the game in `default mode`. The snake will only eat resources of type `pod` and avoid system critical workloads in `kube-system`.

To specify a configuration file, use the `--config/-c` flag.

```sh
./chaossnake --config config.json
```
This will run the game in `config mode`. The snake will eat all resource types in all namespaces defined in the configuration file.

### Example Configuration File

```json
{
    "resource_types": ["pods", "replicasets", "deployments", "services"],
    "namespaces": {
        "include": ["grafana", "default", "netfetch", "podinfo", "workloads"],
        "exclude": ["kube-system"]
}
```

## Playing Chaos Snake

Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake around the screen:

| Key | Action               |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Arrow up        | Move up              |
| Arrow down      | Move down            |
| Arrow left      | Move left            |
| Arrow right     | Move right           |
| Space           | Pause or Resume      |
| CTRL + C        | Quit the game        |

## Kubernetes interaction

Chaos Snake will needs access to a Kubernetes cluster. Ensure your `kubeconfig` is set up correctly before starting the game. The application currently expects the default kubeconfig or a kubeconfig environment variable.

As you play and the pods are deleted, Chaos Snake will log its actions to a `chaos.log` file for your review.
