## ‚≠ê What is Serpent? ‚≠ê

Serpent is a classic snake game with a Kubernetes twist. As you play the game and eat the food, Serpent will randomly delete a pod in your Kubernetes cluster, adding an element of chaos engineering to your gameplay.

### How does it work? ü§î

While you control the snake around the screen, each piece of food it eats corresponds to a pod in your Kubernetes cluster. When the snake eats the food, Serpent will issue a command to delete the associated pod, testing the resilience of your system.

## Installation

### Build from source üíª

To build Serpent from the source, you need a working Go environment with version 1.21 or higher. Follow these steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deggja/serpent.git
cd serpent
go build -o serpent
```

## Usage

### Starting the game

To start the game, simply run the compiled binary:

```sh
./serpent
```

## Playing Serpent

Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake around the screen:

- **Up arrow** - Move up
- **Down arrow** - Move down
- **Left arrow** - Move left
- **Right arrow** - Move right

## Kubernetes interaction

Serpent will require access to your Kubernetes cluster. Ensure your `kubeconfig` is set up correctly before starting the game. The application currently expects the kubeconfig at its default location.

As you play and the pods are deleted, Serpent will log the actions to a `debug.log` file for your review.
